				<h2>Our Story</h2>
				<p>When the world began, Man received a divine mandate to â€œbe fruitful, multiply and fill the earth and subdue it using all its vast resources in the service of God and Manâ€. That was the advent of entrepreneurship; the use of ideas and epignosis to advance the frontiers of human existence. </p>

				<p>However, the process of building ideas into profitable enterprises and successful establishments regardless of its size (micro, small, medium or large) is no easy task.</p>

				<p>Manâ€™s quest to exercise the fullness of the potential imbued into him has led to the discovery of amazing and exciting opportunities, ideas and concepts of innovation that needs to be transformed into successful enterprises. The productive running activities of growing and established enterprises isnâ€™t glamorous, itâ€™s not a televised event. Honestly itâ€™s not that interesting.</p>

				<p>This stimulates the need for a specialist organization that can provide a wholistic bouquet of solutions to help the entrepreneur get along in their quest for success. It ignites the need for an inept institution with value offerings that meet the strategic needs of entrepreneurship and enterprise development.</p>

				<p>It calls for Rendzina Capital, an organization with a passionate resolve to provide services and solutions that perform catalyst functions for people in business. At Rendzina Capital, Providing services, solutions and resources that support a wide and almost limitless variety of business owners is our mission. We take pride in being the 'Enablers of Business Support for micro, small, medium and large scale enterprises '. Leveraging on our diverse functional expertise, we offer services of support in every functional area of business.</p>

				<p>We find our place in contribution to the advancement of humanity as we engage in activities and engagements that permit us to foster entrepreneurship and develop globally competitive enterprises.</p>

				<h2>How We Do It</h2>
				<p>We have carefully chosen to build our business operational strategy around a set of values that allow for congruent emphasis and deliberate intention in all our work. So we choose to work with the ANTS model where there is an expression of the elements of our core values represented in all our tasks using the character of the â€œantsâ€ as guiding principles for all our actions.</p>

				<p>As a team of intelligent, versatile, innovative & hard-working professionals digitally enabled to deliver services to clients anywhere in Africa.</p>

				<p>Be it rain or shine, the ants go about gathering food with the same determination. Despite no supervision, they go about their job with little or no confusion. There is an unspoken trust amongst the species that gets them to co-exist happily in any condition. </p>

				<p>At Rendzina Capital, we have adopted that celebrated TRUST as our core discipline.</p>
					<!-- <img src="images/aboutus.png" alt="" style="width:344px" /> -->
				<p>By working with the ants model, we are able to reach out to clients all across the geographical landscape of Africa. We are able to answer questions, research intently and deliver results profitably</p>
